# Translating EasyAdmin

You can Translate EasyAdmin quickly and easily, just copy the en.json in the "languages" folder and call it what your language is called!

For french, this would be "fr.json", german "de.json", english "en.json" and so on.

Once you have edited all the entries in your file, set the ea_LanguageName convar to what your language (file) is called, then refresh&restart EasyAdmin and the language should appear ingame.

Don't forget to put your name up top ;)

If you find everything to be working correctly, feel free to create a pull request and have your language added to the EasyAdmin Roster, every addition is greatly apprechiated ;)
